### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
    I enjoyed doing part 1 of Lab 3 because I was always curious about how to apply math equations in coding. I was able to learn about data types and see how they can be used. This lab also introduced me to the use of the make file and its features. 

* Lab 2 
    This lab was very important to me because it showed me how to use inputs and outputs which is very fundamental. It was also one of the first labs were I was able to trace and debug code. I was also able to practice the Google c++ coding style. 

* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 1, I was able to read and write from files which was  new to me, so I enjoyed having that experience. I put into practice the use of ifstream. I then learned how to write a program that determined if a number was prime.
